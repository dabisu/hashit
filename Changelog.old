2004-06-21 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

   * hashit.c: Initialize nelems in hashit_create

2004-06-15 Henrik Holst <henrik.holst@ecovision.se>

    * hashit.c: Fixed bug in ch_getkeys
    * hashit.h: Added support for C++ programs to use hashit

2004-01-16 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * Relase of hashit 0.9

2004-01-11 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * hashit.c: Fixed hell-of-a-bug in ch_insert that caused duplicated
      keys to be inserted in the hash table.
    * hashit.c, hashit.h: Added two new functions to hashit, one is to
      change the data associated to an element, which is faster that calling
      hashit_insert and hashit_delete if the key has not changed. The 
      second one returns a null terminated array with all the keys contained
      in the hash table. This one has been a feature asked by several
      hashit users ;). Thanks to Muhammad Muquit <muquit@muqit.com> for
      his suggestions, ideas and bug reports ;).
      
2003-12-29 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * hashit.h, hashit: Added some accessor functions.
    * hashit.c: Added a new field to the hash_t structure to keep
      account of the number of elements a table contains.
    * hashit.h, hashit.c: Encapsulate properly all the hash table
      structures and allow access only thru public interfaces. This
      should have been done before O:).
    * Update to MOBS-1.0

2003-10-08 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * Release of hashit 0.8
    * Update to MOBS-1.0rc19.2
    * hashit.h: The union in the main struct for the hash table was made
      anonymous. Gcc 2-95.x doesn't support this extensions and the compilation
      failed.
    * hashit.h, hashit.c: The union change motivated a complete cleaning of
      the name of structs and functions, to make all them more readable.
   
2003-06-17 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * Release of hashit 0.7

2003-06-13 Stan Bielski <stan@ece.cmu.edu>

    * hashit.c: Fixed bug in hashit chained_lookup. First element of the
      bucket list was always referenced instead of cursor...
    * hashit.c: Fixed bug in gethash, now it uses the hash table size minus
      one, so the right value is returned.

2003-05-20 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>

    * Release of hashit 0.6

2002-11-19 David Gómez <david@pleyades.net>
