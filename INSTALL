Compiling & Installing Hashit
=============================

	$ cmake . 
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	hashit now use the CMake building system.

	To install hashit with a different prefix, cmake needs to be
	invoked with the proper environment variables, so to install
	sakura in /usr, you should do:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

	Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug or CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release if you
	wish to select the build type. Default is Release.

	By default hashit is installed /usr/local.

	hashit includes a pkg-config file, therefore you only need to use the
	pkg-config utility in the usual way to link your binary to hashit.
