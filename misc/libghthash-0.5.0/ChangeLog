0.5:
        * Changed the documentation a bit.
	* Rehash before we insert the new entry (at least one less entry
	  to reinsert).
	* Added a benchmark program for different hash tables. The
	  benchmark is basically the dict_example.c program, with backends
	  for different hash tables (currently GNU libc hsearch and the
	  C++ STL hash_map, feel free to add more).
	* Heuristics are only applied on ght_get() now (since they
	  are unessessary for ght_remove() and ght_insert()).
	* No longer calculates the hash value twice for inserting.
	* Removed callocs (replaced with malloc+memset).
	* Changed build system to use GNU automake / autoconf (should now
	  hopefully behave more as a normal library).
	* Added an example program that collects the words from a text
          file, enters those into a hash table and then reads another text
	  file and looks up the words in that in the table. (dict_example.c)
	* Implemented the possibility to do several iterations at once and 
	  therefore changed ght_first() and ght_next().

0.4-MK2
	* Changed the license to GNU LGPL.
	* Fixed bug when rehashing (the size mask was unchanged).
	* Changed the programming interface quite a bit. See the
	  documentation for more about how to use the hash table.
	* Stores key data within the table (i.e. you should no longer
	  pass allocated key data to the table).
	* Added CRC32 hash from comp.compression.FAQ, thanks to
	  Dru Lemley <spambait@lemley.net> for this		
	* Removed shameful performance bug in one-at-a-time hash and
	  rotating hash, found by Dru Lemley <spambait@lemley.net>.
	  This makes use of the table about 2 twice as fast as before...

0.3

	* Added real documentation, built with doxygen.
	* Performance enhancements by using powers of two for table size,
	  allowing divisions to be replaced with binary ANDs.
	* Freeing an entry frees the associated key as well,
	  even if b_delete_data is FALSE.
	* The keys are hopefully free'd correctly now.
	* Replaced runtime checks for NULL with asserts (the program
	  will not work correctly anyhow if you supply the NULLs!)
	* Added simple.c example program.
  

0.2

	* Do not export local functions
	* Added option to manually specify rehashing
