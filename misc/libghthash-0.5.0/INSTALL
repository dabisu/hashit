INSTALLING:
You build the Generic Hash Table by running:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su root
    (passwd)
  # make install

The library is installed in /usr/local/lib and the include-file in
/usr/local/include.

If you don't want to use GNU autoconf, you can compile the hash table
manually. The source file for the hash table is src/hash_table.c. You
will have to copy src/ght_hash_table.h.in to src/ght_hash_table.h and
manually edit src/ght_hash_table.c and replace @INT32_T@ with the 32
bit integer on your system (most likely int).

You can then link the object-file hash_table.o with your application,
or create a library of it (how to do that varies between systems).
