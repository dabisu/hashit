INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a benchmark suite for hash tables. It currently tests
libghthash, GNU libc hsearch and the C++ STL hash_map.


USAGE
-----
Compile by running "make" (needs stdc++ with hash_map, GNU libc and
libghthash).

You run the benchmark by running do_benchmark.sh with two arguments -
the text file to collect words from and the text file to match the
words against.


EXTENSIONS
----------

You can add more implementations by implementing the functions in
bench.h (except do_benchmark) for your hash table. Have a look at
bench_ght.c or some of the other hash table hooks and it should be
pretty self explanatory.
